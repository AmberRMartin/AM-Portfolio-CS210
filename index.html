                                        <br><br><i> Thoughts:</i> This was back in CS151 class when we had a final to make a game. 
                                        I would show more here, but my primary job was appearances. 
                                        I also took up the job as general manager in hopes of keeping the project on track so 
                                        it could be done, but there's only so much I could do at the time when the others had larger 
                                        coding jobs that took more time than mine. I remember wanting to finish it myself, but then life happened and I didn't have time anymore

                                        I also remember working MUCH faster than my partner did, though to no fault of his own. 
                                        I just enjoy making games and got carried away and didn't leave much coding for him. <br> Sorry dude

-CS151 final, in terms of visuals
        -> Graphic artist. I can get the images straight from the CS151 repository 
-Battleship thing if I still have it for coding
        -> C++, ability to work in teams
-Junk python script
        -> Multiple languages
-Web scraper
        -> Coding ability

Note: remember that I have to fork the respositories to link them
        -> You can no longer can access permissions of forked repostiories.
Note: Add a third box under respository because Work will DEFINITELY get too long
Note: well there's a third box now. it's still too long.

                -> event listeners
-Dropdown boxes for old thoughts? (Note: out of patience)
