                                        <br><br><i> Thoughts:</i> This was back in CS151 class when we had a final to make a game. 
                                        I would show more here, but my primary job was appearances. 
                                        I also took up the job as general manager in hopes of keeping the project on track so 
                                        it could be done, but there's only so much I could do at the time when the others had larger 
                                        coding jobs that took more time than mine. I remember wanting to finish it myself, but then life happened and I didn't have time anymore

                                        I also remember working MUCH faster than my partner did, though to no fault of his own. 
                                        I just enjoy making games and got carried away and didn't leave much coding for him. <br> Sorry dude :(

                                        I like working with shells in general, though, even if the syntax can get a bit confusing. Fortunately for me, I actually like learning new syntax! Most of the time. <br>
